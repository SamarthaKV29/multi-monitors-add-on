# Debugging Instructions for Multi Monitors Add-On

## How to View Extension Logs

When troubleshooting issues with the Multi Monitors extension, especially indicator transfers, you can view the logs with:

```bash
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell
```

This will show real-time logs from GNOME Shell, including the ones generated by this extension.

## Troubleshooting Indicator Transfers

If indicators aren't showing up on secondary monitors after adding them in preferences:

1. **Check Available Indicators**:
   - Make sure the indicator you're trying to transfer actually exists in the main panel
   - Some indicators might have names that don't match what you see (e.g., "KStatusNotifierItem" instead of "Dropbox")

2. **Restart the Shell**:
   - After adding indicators, try restarting GNOME Shell (Alt+F2, type 'r', press Enter)
   - This will reload everything cleanly

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - Look for log entries like "Adding indicator X to transfers" and "Transferred indicator X to monitor Y"
   - Any errors during the transfer process will be logged

4. **Fix for Non-showing Indicators**:
   If indicators are in the list but not showing up:
   
   ```javascript
   // To test in Looking Glass (Alt+F2, type 'lg', press Enter)
   // List all status area indicators
   Object.keys(Main.panel.statusArea)
   
   // Manually transfer an indicator to monitor 0
   let ind = 'indicatorName';  // Use one from the list above
   let cont = Main.panel.statusArea[ind].container;
   cont.unparent();
   Main.mmPanel[0]._rightBox.add_child(cont);
   ```

## Common Issues

1. **Newly Added Apps**: Some indicators may only appear after the app is launched, so make sure the app is running.

2. **Indicators Missing from Available List**:
   - The extension might not be detecting all potential indicators
   - Check your logs for the available indicators list

3. **Indicators Disappear After Reboot**:
   - This should be fixed now with the transfer system
   - If it still happens, the settings might not be saving properly

## Manual Reset

If things get completely stuck, you can reset the extension settings:

```bash
dconf reset -f /org/gnome/shell/extensions/multi-monitors-add-on/
```

This will clear all settings back to defaults.
